# bsglrender
Making a renderer for cows.

This project is on hiatus. It's intended to have minimal dependencies but I currently don't have time to implement
all the more tedious things. So with my limited time I'm going to work on a project that uses libraries to take care
of the tedium and focus more on graphics! Hopefully I can revisit this and merge my work.
